Iterator design pattern is a behavioural design pattern that lays down a way to access elements of a collection sequentially. It provides a way for us to implement the accessibility of elements without exposing the underlying representation of the container. A container can be a list, set, multiset, trees, and graphs, and by underlying representation we mean the way the container has been composed with its methods and properties. If you have come across iterators or “iterables” before, they are in a more general sense something that can be looped over, using a standard loop.
